# SF Crime Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting crime in San Francisco. Due to GitHub's file size limit, some large HTML files are stored as zip files within the repository.

## Project Description

The project aims to analyze crime data in San Francisco and build models to predict crime occurrences. 

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process is divided into three notebooks. The main one is `SF_crime_prediction.ipynb`. Datasets are merged and final touches are done in that notebook.

Due to GitHub's 100 MB size limit, large visualizations are stored as HTML files and zipped. These files can be found in the repository.
